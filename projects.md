### Autonomous Vehicle-Pedestrian Interaction

This project looks at the interaction problem between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians. Given fully-autonomous vehicles will not have a driver on board, pedestrians will no longer receive familiar cues from the driver such as eye gaze and gesture to aid them in making street crossing decisions. 

### Safety in Close Proximity in Human-Robot Interaction

This project explores the question of safety in close proximity interaction of people and robots. Specifically, we have looked at whether instinctive defensive behaviors that people exhibit when faced with threat stimuli manifest in similar ways when faced with unsafe robots. We hope to incorporate this understanding of human defensive behavior in the design of robot behavior.
