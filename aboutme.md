I'm a MSc student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Calgary, Canada. I am supervised by Dr. Ehud Sharlin from the University of Calgary and Dr. Sowmya Somanath from OCAD University. 

I am passionate about research in the realm of human-robot interaction. I am currently exploring the interaction of autonomous vehicles and pedestrians.


### Background

I have a BSc in Electrical Engineering from the University of Alberta, Canada.
